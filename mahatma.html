            Gandhi led India to independence from the British Raj without using violence. His name will be eternally associated with the doctrine of peaceful resistance.
            <br><br>
            Gandhi had a great influence since he was little, and he learned from a very young age to fast to purify himself, to not harm any living being, to tolerate other religious beliefs, and to be a vegetarian. He was the youngest of the three sons of the union between Karamchand Gandhi and Putlibai.
            <br><br>
            Gandhi was a withdrawn young man, silent and not at all brilliant in school. At the age of thirteen, his parents, following the Hindu custom, married him to a girl of his age called Kasturbai, with whom from the age of six he was already committed without having any idea.
            <br><br>
            Nevertheless, in July 1894, when he was barely 25, he blossomed within an overnight into a proficient campaigner.
            <br><br>
            He drafted several petitions to the British government and the Natal Legislature and signed by hundreds of his compatriots

            In 1896, Gandhi returned to India to fetch his wife, Kasturba (or Kasturbai), and their two oldest children and amass support for the Indians overseas. 
            <br><br>
            He met the prominent leaders and persuaded them to address the public meetings in the centre of the country's principal cities. Unfortunately for him, middle versions of his activities and utterances reached Natal and provoked its European population.

            Mahatma Gandhi's death was a tragic event and brought clouds of sorrow to millions of people.
            <br><br>
            On the 29th of January, a man named Nathuram Godse came to Delhi with an automatic pistol. In the evening, at about 5 pm, he went to Gardens of Birla house, and in a sudden, a man from the crowd came out and bowed before him. 
            <br><br>
            Mahatma Gandhi was in such a posture as welcoming that man to kill him and fall to the ground. During his death, he uttered Ram Ram.
            <br><br>
            Although someone could have called the doctor in this critical situation during that time, no one thought of that, and Gandhiji died within half an hour.
            <br><br>
            In the boarding houses and vegetarian restaurants of England, Gandhi met not only the food enthusiasts but some earnest men and women to whom he owed the introduction to the Bible and, more importantly, the Bhagavadgita, which he read for the first time in its English translation by Sir Edwin Arnold.
